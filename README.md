# Eclipse Whiskers

Whiskers is an [OGC SensorThings API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SensorThings_API) framework consisting of a JavaScript client and a light-weight server for IoT gateways (e.g., Raspberry Pi). The SensorThings API is an OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standard that allows IoT (Internet of Things) devices and their data to be connected; a major goal is to foster a healthy and open IoT ecosystem, as opposed to one dominated by proprietary information silos.

In addition the a client library, Whiskers will also have a SensorThings server module for IoT gateways, such as Raspberry Pi. Developers will be able to deploy and configure IoT gateways, make them SensorThings API-compliant, and connect with spatial data servers around the world that implement the full array of [OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards](http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/markets-technologies/swe).

Whiskers aims to make SensorThings development easy for the large and growing world of IoT developers.

More details can be found on the [Eclipse Whiskers Project](http://eclipse.org/whiskers) page.

## Using Eclipse Whiskers

Eclipse Whiskers is still in an early development stage. We will soon be updating this README document with a guide on using both the Client Library and Server Module. Hang tight!

## Versioning

Whiskers aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org). This means you can expect the library to be stable on Major version numbers, with only backwards-compatible changes on Minor and Patch version number changes. An exception is made for versions before 1.0.0, where the API is unstable while our development team focuses on a unified API â€” that means releases before 1.0.0 may introduce breaking changes between Minor versions.

## Issues

You can submit issues through GitHub, through Eclipse Bugzilla, or on the mailing list.
